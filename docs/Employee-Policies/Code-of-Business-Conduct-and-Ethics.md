# **General Principles of Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBE)**

Krenovate is driven by a set of values, which are embedded in each of our activities and processes. These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct.

The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent.

## **General Employee Responsibilities**

All Employees are expected to:

-   Understand the importance of each Krenovate policy and guideline in relation to his/her job and follow it religiously.
-   Know that violation of any Krenovate policy and guideline will result in disciplinary action (including immediate termination of employment).
-   Use good judgement abd demonstrate a high degree of personal integrity and honesty at all times, even in situations that are not specifically addressed by this COBE or by a Krenovate policy.


## **What Managers Need to Know**

In most cases, a Krenovate manager will be the first person to be contacted by an Employee whi believes that a Krenovate policy has been, or may be, violated. Thus, managers play a vital role in ensuring compliance with this COBE, Krenovate policies and applicable laws and regulations and they must:

-   Be familiar with Krenovate policies and guidelines so that they can inform their subordinates about the policies that relate to their jobs and expectations with respect to such policies.
-   Be perceptive to potential problems or compliance issues that could arise in their area of responsibility.
-   Learn not to, "look the other way"; if there is a potential or actual problem or issue, report it immediately so that prompt action can be taken, if necessary.


## **Assistance**

If an Employee or Representative needs more information or have questions about any Krenovate policy, they may contact the following:

1.  His/her manager
2.  Human Resource Department
3.  Legal Department
4.  Any member of the Executive Team

## **Development and Protection of Intellectual Property**

Krenovate vigorously protects all of its confidential information and intellectual property (IP), whether in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks, and expects its Employees and Representatives to do the same. It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate.

Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author.

Trademarks (such as name, logo, combination of the name and logo) serve to identify products and services in the market and are distinctive in nature. Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, (c) they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation.

Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel.

When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate. Subject to the relevant legislations, this applies no matter where or when- at work or after hours- such information (in tangible or intangible form) is created and is irrespective of the capacity in which the Employee created such work- be it managerial, technical, scientific or professional. All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee.

In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others.

All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team.

## **Maintaining Confidentiality**

Krenovate Employees are required to keep all Krenovate confidential information, which is received or accessible during and subsequent to employment, in strictest confidence and protect them from unauthorised disclosure. Confidential information includes all information thta is not available in the public domain, such as IP; trade secrets; business; marketing and service plans; databases and records; login details; salary information; customer and supplier lists; major contracts and any unpublished financial data and reports. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them by Krenovate and/or its clients and/or suppliers. Krenovate's policy requires that all disclosures of confidential information are done only after the party, to whom the information is to be disclosed, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Krenovate.

Employees should not disclose, publish, communicate, described directly or indirectly, in any form or manner any confidential information to any third party without a valid business purpose and proper authorisation from Executive Team and the Legal Department. Employees are also required not to disclose confidential information (even within Krenovate) to anyone who does not need to have such confidential information.

Employees need to have safeguards against not only intentional and wilful disclosures but also against inadvertent disclosures. Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to be aware and alert of such circumstances or situations where there is a chance of an unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Examples of such circumstances can be: discussing client related information or other confidential information with a colleague in a crowded elevator or during lunch hour sitting in the cafeteria where Employees from other teams are also seated. Krenovate Employees are strictly prohibited from discussing Krenovate confidential information with their family members or friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass such information on to someone else. Not only are Employees required to maintain the confidentiality of the information but they should only use it for Krenovate business and not for any personal benefit or reasons. Employees are urged to be aware of social engineering techniques deployed for extracting confidential information.

With regard to Information owned by/about other parties, Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to:

-   Not exercise improper/illegal means for obtaining information about Krenovate competitors.
-   Not attempt or solicit or obtain competitive intelligence through improper means or through means which could be disparaging to Krenovate reputation.
-   Treat information of all third parties (including Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients) with utmost care and confidentiality and respect the privacy rights of such parties.
-   Treat any proprietary information of another party that is received, with caution to prevent any accusations that Krenovate misappropriated or misused such information.
-   Only disclose confidential information about Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients to those Employees who need to know such information to transact business with such suppliers, vendors or clients.
-   Exercise extra caution while dealing with clients personnel about whom there may be reasonable ground of belief that, due to change in client's organisation internal dynamics, such personnel may become unauthorised to receive/access any confidential information.
-   Regard all information received as Confidential, if it is not known that such information is confidential or not, and to exercise all due care with regard to maintaining confidentiality of such information.

All queries in this regard should be referred to the Legal Department.


## **Compliance with Laws**

Krenovate ensures that it complies with ail the relevant legislations and that we conduct our business within the framework of applicable laws and regulations. Violations of laws, regulations, rules and orders may subject the violator to individual criminal or civil liability, as well as to disciplinary action by Krenovate.

### **_Compliance with Competition Laws_**

Krenovate's belief is that fair competition is fundamental to free enterprise and it is committed to ensure compliance with the competition laws of various countries as may be applicable to Krenovate business operations. These laws, known under various names such as antitrust, monopoly, fair trade etc, are designed to protect the market competitive process and to ensure that it is fair and healthy. These laws prohibit illegal agreements; collusion among competitors; formal or informal agreements with competitors that harm competition or customers; bid rigging, price fixing and allocations of clients, territories or contracts; the acquisition or nnaintenance of a monopoly or attempted monopoly through anti-competitive conduct etc.

To ensure compliance with the various competition laws and in line with Krenovate policy, Krenovate strongly advocates that the following are strictly adhered to:

-   **Avoiding reciprocal dealing** — avoidance of any kind of understanding with a client or supplier, which conditions sales or purchases of Krenovate products on reciprocal sales or purchases of the client's/supplier's products.
-   Participation in meetings where competitors are present: No Employee or Representative should attend or remain present at any meeting where there is a discussion by competitors on any subject which the Employee or Representative would be otherwise precluded from discussing with the competitor. Additionally, no Employee or Representative should attend or remain present at any informal trade association meeting of competitor members held for the purpose of discussing business matters, without observing the formal procedural requirements established by the trade association for its business meetings. Employees and Representatives should be aware that participation in standard development and product certification activities that impact competitors or suppliers may raise antitrust concerns. Therefore, before participating Employees and Representatives should consult with tha Legal Department.
-   **Discussions with competitors** — No Employee or Representative shall enter into any understanding or agreement, whether express or implied, formal or informal, written or oral with a competitor limiting or restricting in any of the following: prices, costs, profits, product or service offerings, terms or conditions of sale, production or sales volumes, production facilities or capacity, market share, decisions to quote or not quote certain business, sales territories, clients, distribution methods etc. Employees and Representatives who do have contact with competitors should be ever mindful of not placing themselves in positions which might create the "appearance of impropriety." As a result, no Employee or Representative should discuss with or accept information from a competitor or any other third party acting for a competitor, on any subject as to which an understanding with the competitor would be prohibited.

Antitrust laws impose severe penalties, including criminal penalties, for certain types of violations. All Employees and Representatives who have periodic contact with competitors of Krenovate need to be ever mindful of these laws and strive to avoid placing themselves in situations that might create even the appearance of impropriety. Employees in managerial positions will be responsible for taking appropriate measures in their respective areas to achieve strict legal compliance, both by themselves and by their subordinates.

When a situation is unclear, seek advice from the Legal Department.

### **_Compliance with International Trade Controls_**

All Employees and Representatives must understand and follow applicable international trade control and customs laws and regulations, including those relating to licensing, shipping and import documentation and other such requirements. They should be aware that the trade control laws of various countries might be applicable to Krenovate because these laws apply to business operations and import-export transactions from and to such countries. Such laws govern not only the sale and purchase of goods or products but also cover wide amplitude of technology and information transfer/re-transfer shipment etc.

Employees are required to screen all transactions in accordance with applicable export/import requirements/laws. They are charged with the duty know the client to whom an item/information is being exported or information is being transferred (be it information embedded in software or via email), the end use of the item/information and its final destination.

Krenovate's general policy is not to undertake work or service which will be used directly for any military/defence/security product or service. An exception to this may be obtained with explicit authorisation from the Executive Team, in consultation with the Legal Department.


### **_Compliance with Anti-boycott laws and Embargoes_**
