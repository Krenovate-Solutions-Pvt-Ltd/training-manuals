# **End User Computing Policy**

## **Overview/Purpose**

The purpose of this Booklet is to enable end-users to understand the security requirements and policies to be followed for day-to-day computing activities. End-user Computing Policy is aimed at providing preventive/corrective measures to be taken for minimising risks arising from computing resources used by end-users.

The policy statements in the End-user Computing Policy document are extracted from core Krenovate Information Security Policies.

The objectives of this policy are as follows:

-   To set forth, acceptable usage norms for the Krenovate End-user computing resources;
-   To foster and maintain an environment where the management and end-users have confidence in the security of these resources;
-   To ensure that all applicable hardware inventory and software licensing requirements are met; and
-   Establish consistency in computer use procedures and regulations at Krenovate.


## **Scope**

This poiicy is applicable to all users of computing resources at Krenovate. The term "resources" includes, but is not necessarily limited to:

-   Personal Computers/Laptops (networked and stand-alone);
-   Network Infrastructure (includes active networking equipment, data ports, connecting cables and switches);
-   Project Servers;
-   Internal Tools and Software;
-   Application Servers;
-   Database Servers;
-   Intranet Servers; or
-   Gateways used to access external networks, such as the Internet.

## **User Responsibilities**

-   Users should understand and follow the Information Security Policies of Krenovate as they relate to safeguarding of information assets. Users will be accountable for their actions.
-   Users need to respect the rights of other users, including their rights as set forth in other policies; these rights include but are not limited to privacy, freedom from harassment and freedom of expression.
-   Users should respect the computing needs of others by not deliberately performing acts that are wasteful of computing resources or those thet unfairly monopolise resources to the exclusion of other users.
-   Users are not permitted to use the name of Krenovate clients in their general communication (written or verbal) unless required for the business function.

-   Data stored on local hard drives is susceptibie to toss of critical files. Chances of recovering data from hardware failures or loss of disk resources are less, thus users should save their project- related data on the network file servers.
-   Important files such as client project deliverables should be stored on network file servers in the client deliverables folder with appropriate access control measures (accessible only to the respective project team and the project owner) on the completion of the projects or on appropriate milestones [as decided by the project manager(s)].
-   Users will work and save all their project-related data in the client project's Work in Progress (WIP) folder on the network file server till the completion of the project or as decided by the project manager(s).
-   Users will be responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of research work/deliverables and other business documents developed/processed by them for performing their job.
-   Users are accountable for ensuring that information being processed by them is made available only to the authorised employees within the organisation.

-   The content of any infortnation made available to others via the Krenovate network is the sole responsibility of the project manager(s) handling the project/the employee who is sending the information.
-   Information contained in computer files should be accessed or used for authorised business purposes only. Casual browsing of computer files stored on other user's machines for personal reasons is strictly prohibited.
-   Personal software/software downloaded from the Internet should not be loaded on Krenovate computers. If there is a specific reason for which the same needs to be done, a prior approval of both the CISO and the respective business function head needs to be obtained.
