# **List of Policies**

## **General Principles of Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBE)**

Krenovate is driven by a set of values, which are embedded in each of our activities and processes. These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct.

The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent.

### **General Employee Responsibilities**

All Employees are expected to:

-   Understand the importance of each Krenovate policy and guideline in relation to his/her job and follow it religiously.
-   Know that violation of any Krenovate policy and guideline will result in disciplinary action (including immediate termination of employment).
-   Use good judgement abd demonstrate a high degree of personal integrity and honesty at all times, even in situations that are not specifically addressed by this COBE or by a Krenovate policy.


### **What Managers Need to Know**

In most cases, a Krenovate manager will be the first person to be contacted by an Employee whi believes that a Krenovate policy has been, or may be, violated. Thus, managers play a vital role in ensuring compliance with this COBE, Krenovate policies and applicable laws and regulations and they must:

-   Be familiar with Krenovate policies and guidelines so that they can inform their subordinates about the policies that relate to their jobs and expectations with respect to such policies.
-   Be perceptive to potential problems or compliance issues that could arise in their area of responsibility.
-   Learn not to, "look the other way"; if there is a potential or actual problem or issue, report it immediately so that prompt action can be taken, if necessary.


### **Assistance**

1.  His/her manager
2.  Human Resource Department
3.  Legal Department
4.  Any member of the Executive Team

Employees and Representatives must not, as part of engaging in any outside activities, misuse Krenovate resources, discredit its name and reputation or affect its business in any way.

### **Development and Protection of Intellectual Property**

Krenovate vigorously protects all of its confidential information and intellectual property (IP), whether in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks, and expects its Employees and Representatives to do the same. It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate.

Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author.

Trademarks (such as name, logo, combination of the name and logo) serve to identify products and services in the market and are distinctive in nature. Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, (c) they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation.

Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel.

When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate. Subject to the relevant legislations, this applies no matter where or when- at work or after hours- such information (in tangible or intangible form) is created and is irrespective of the capacity in which the Employee created such work- be it managerial, technical, scientific or professional. All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee.

In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others.

All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team.
