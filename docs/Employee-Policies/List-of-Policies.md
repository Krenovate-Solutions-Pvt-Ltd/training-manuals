# **List of Policies**

## **General Principles of Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBE)**

Krenovate is driven by a set of values, which are embedded in each of our activities and processes. These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct.

The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent.

### **_General Employee Responsibilities_**

All Employees are expected to:

-   Understand the importance of each Krenovate policy and guideline in relation to his/her job and follow it religiously.
-   Know that violation of any Krenovate policy and guideline will result in disciplinary action (including immediate termination of employment).
-   Use good judgement abd demonstrate a high degree of personal integrity and honesty at all times, even in situations that are not specifically addressed by this COBE or by a Krenovate policy.


### **_What Managers Need to Know_**

In most cases, a Krenovate manager will be the first person to be contacted by an Employee whi believes that a Krenovate policy has been, or may be, violated. Thus, managers play a vital role in ensuring compliance with this COBE, Krenovate policies and applicable laws and regulations and they must:

-   Be familiar with Krenovate policies and guidelines so that they can inform their subordinates about the policies that relate to their jobs and expectations with respect to such policies.
-   Be perceptive to potential problems or compliance issues that could arise in their area of responsibility.
-   Learn not to, "look the other way"; if there is a potential or actual problem or issue, report it immediately so that prompt action can be taken, if necessary.
