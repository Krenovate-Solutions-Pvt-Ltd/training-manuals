-   Unwanted and persistent explicit or implicit propositions to engage in sexual activity;

A single, isolated incident of such conduct (especially when the harasser has direct influence over the complainant), if sufficiently severe, may constitute Sexual Harassment under this Policy.

## **Employees' Obligations**

Pursuant to the preventive steps explained above, Krenovate Employees shall have a responsibility to:

-   Attend orientation/awareness session programs to be better informed about Sexual Harassment;

-   Desist from and discourage spreading of rumours with regard to any instance of Sexual Harassment; and

## **Complaints of Sexual Harassment**

If any Employee at Krenovate believes that she/he has been subjected to Sexual Harassment, she/he can avail of either an informal or formal complaint mechanism as described below.

### **_Informal Complaint Process_**

For anyone seeking informal support/intervention to stop unwelcome behaviour, such person can approach his/her respective group managers or AVP, member of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee (ASHC)/ ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) or any other equivalent so designated by Krenovate (hereafter referred to as First Instance Person or FIP) as a point of first contact. Such FIPS shall be empowered to intervene to stop the unwelcome behaviour. Examples Of instances where a FIP may intervene include the following:

-   *X repeatedly tells off-colour jokes which are sexually loaded and create discomfort for Y. The FIP may warn X to desist from such behaviour.*
-   *D, a colleague, persists in inviting E to go out for lunch. E has refused earlier, but D persists with his unsolicited invitations. The FIP may issue a warning to D to refrain from making such invitations.*
-   *A makes sexually suggestive remarks about B's personal life. The FIP may demand an apology from A to B and warn A to desist from making such remarks.*

An informal process can often address unwelcome conduct/behaviour in the first instance before it escalates. At the same time it helps to diffuse a situation without diluting the problem. However, if the conduct persists or is determined by the FIP in consultation with the complainant to be of a serious nature, the complainant shall have a right to refer the matter to a formal complaint mechanism described below.


### **_Formal Complaint Process_**

An Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee (ASHC)/ ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) will be constituted in the respective offices. Employees who believe that they have been subjected to Sexual Harassment will be encouraged to lodge a written complaint either personally or through a FIP who may have assisted the complainants or through those who have otherwise observed the Sexual Harassment as per the guidelines laid down in their respective offices.

#### **_Requirements of a Complaint_**

A complaint of Sexual Harassment should (to the extent practicable) be made in writing within a period of 3 months from the date of the incident and in case of a series of incidents, within a period of 3 months from the date of the last incident. If however the Committee is satisfied that the circumstances which prevented the complainant from filling a complaint within this period, it may for reasons recorded in writing, accept the complaint. However, given the importance of documenting a complaint of workplace sexual harassment, steps should be taken to do so at the earliest. The written account should include the date, time and place of the unwelcome conduct, a description of the events resulting in the misconduct, the complainant's response, and the names of witnesses, if any, present at the time of the inappropriate conduct or to whom the complainant may have spoken subsequent to the incident. While Krenovate appreciates the difficulty involved in detailing some kinds of Sexual Harassment, a complainant is encouraged to document as much detail as possible to allow for an effective response to the inappropriate conduct.


#### **_Procedure on receipt of a Complain_**

On receipt of a complaint, an ASHC member, chairperson, or FIP or any other person to whom the complaint has been lodged will be available to provide information on Krenovate's complaint process as per the applicable Anti-Sexual Harassment Guidelines. Thereafter, the appropriate process which is established at the respective Krenovate country office will be followed.

## **Retaliation and/or creation of hostile work environment prohibited**

This Policy encourages employees to freely, responsibly, and in an orderly manner express any problem or complaint involving Sexual Harassment. All formal complaints of Sexual Harassment will be investigated. All steps shall be taken to ensure that neither the complainants nor those cooperating with an investigation, including witnesses are victimized or discriminated against in any way while dealing with a complaint of Sexual Harassment.

## **Confidentiality**

All complaints of Sexual Harassment will be kept and treated as confidential to the extent practicable under the circumstances. Only those individuals who may have received the complaint or are necessarily involved in an investigatory process and in the decision regarding resolution of the complaint will ordinarily be provided access to the information regarding any allegation of Sexual Harassment. All information regarding Sexual Harassment complaints will be maintained in a confidential file to be kept with the head of the ASHC.


## **Remedies**

An investigation may result in one (or a combination) of the following possible outcomes and consequential actions:

-   That Krenovate's ASH Policy was not violated and that the complaint has not succeeded; or
-   That Krenovate's ASH Policy has been violated, resulting in the imposition of disciplinary action as determined; or
-   Given that Krenovate believes that Sexual Harassment is a serious violation of equality and individual dignity, appropriate action will follow a determination that inappropriate conduct has taken place. Disciplinary action may include oral reprimand, written reprimands, recommendation for suspension without pay, and recommendation for termination. Such action shall be calculated to be commensurate with the violation and as deemed appropriate under the circumstances.


## **Savings**

The proceedings under this Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy shall not be stalled or postponed merely because the complainant is proceeding against the accused under any other provision of law.

The provisions of this Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy shall not restrict the powers of the management or the complainant to proceed against the alleged offender for any other misconduct or other legal remedies.
