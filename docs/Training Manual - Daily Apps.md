GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

3.  Experiment with different versions of a document while maintaining the original version.
4.  ‘Merge’ two versions of a document and manage conflicts between versions.
5.  Revert changes, moving ‘backwards’ through your history to previous versions of your document.
