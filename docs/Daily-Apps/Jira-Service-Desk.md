# **Jira Service Desk**

### **_Introduction_**

Jira Service Desk is simply modern service desk software. It brings more structure to your work, gives you increased visibility into what your team is up to, and helps your team members get more done, so you can deliver better service. It is used primarily:

*   By teams who receive incoming issues/requests from other teams/customers.
*   Is designed specifically for end-users to submit tickets to a help desk team.

### **_Why use Jira Service Desk_**

    * Build templates for users to enter all the details you need.
    * Display contextual information, re-map statuses, and hide fields your users don’t need.

    *   Set up advanced SLA metrics with complex start, pause, and stop criteria.
    * Ensure your IT teams keep priorities front of mind with clear countdown and color codes for every request
    * Let Jira automatically apply relevant targets on each new request with its powerful rules engine.

    * Apply SLA metrics retroactively to your current Jira data to observe trends

### **_Jira Service Desk Features_**

Once you have navigated to your service desk, you’ll find the sidebar, which has helpful features which you may want to use:

*   Queues

Queues are where your agents work on customer requests. As a project administrator, you’ll set up and configure queues to triage requests to the right service desk agents. Your agents will then view and work on these requests from your queues.

*   Reports

You can use reports to visualize trends in your service desk. As a project administrator, you can also set up custom reports to discover new trends not displayed by the default reports.

*   Channels

Channels are where you can find the ways customers send you requests. Here, you can get details for your email, help center, and widget channels.

*   Project settings

Project settings are where you can configure your service desk. Here, you can set up request types, link your service desk to an email account, manage users, and more.


### **_Service Desk Project_**

You can create *projects* in Jira Service Desk. Projects are service desks that provide help to customers. You can create multiple projects to give each service team in your organization their own service desk. For example, you might have a Finance, a HR, Facilities, IT or Legal service desk project.

Customers can access every service desk project that you’ve given them permission to from the help center—an online place for them to request help.

Before you create a service desk project, you choose a project template for it. After you sign up for Jira Service Desk, you’re asked to choose a template for your first service desk project. Depending on your organization’s needs, we start your project with reports, request types and other tools. You can always configure your project later.
