## **Working with Github in VS Code**

Using GitHub with Visual Studio Code lets you share your source code and collaborate with others. GitHub integration is provided through the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension.

We use the [Desktop Github](Desktop-Github.md) to integrate the code with Github.

## **Markdown and Visual Studio Code**

At Krenovate, we use "Markdown" as the source code language. 

Markdown files have an extension as ".md".

Working with Markdown files in Visual Studio Code is simple, straightforward, and fun. Besides VS Code's basic editing, there are a number of Markdown specific features that will help you be more productive.

Learn more about [Markdown](Markdown.md) here.

## **How to Edit files in Visual Code Editor**

When you are ready to work in the Visual Studio Code, follow the below steps:

1.  Go to -> File -> Open Folder
2.  Select the "folder/repository" on your local machine you want to work on.

    ![open folder](../images/Initial-images/VSCode/openfoldervsc.jpg)

3.  Start adding/editing content as per requirement. You can add multiple folders and .md files to your repository.

    ![make changes](../images/Initial-images/VSCode/makechangesvsc.jpg)

4.  Make changes to the [mkdocs.yml file](mkdocs-yml.md). This is a very important step. Without updating the .yml file, the content of your documentation will not show properly on the website.

All the changes that you make in the repository, will show up in the [Desktop Github](Desktop-Github.md) window.
