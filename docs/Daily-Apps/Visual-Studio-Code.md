## **_Working with Github in VS Code_**

Using GitHub with Visual Studio Code lets you share your source code and collaborate with others. GitHub integration is provided through the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension.

We use the [Desktop Github](Desktop-Github.md) to integrate the code with Github.

## **_Markdown and Visual Studio Code_**

At Krenovate, we use "Markdown" as the source code language. 

Markdown files have an extension as ".md".

Working with Markdown files in Visual Studio Code is simple, straightforward, and fun. Besides VS Code's basic editing, there are a number of Markdown specific features that will help you be more productive.
