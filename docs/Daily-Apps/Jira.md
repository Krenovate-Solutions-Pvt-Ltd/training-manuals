# **Jira**

## **Introduction**

JIRA is a tool developed by Australian Company Atlassian. It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. 
The basic use of this tool is to plan, track, and release software.

At Krenovate, Jira is the most important used app due to it's project management and task tracking tools.

This manual is focussed on the Users/team members. It has been designed keeping in mind the steps to be taken by the Team members.

## **Key terms to know**

*   **_Tasks_**

       * A Jira 'task' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. 
       * A task represents work that needs to be done.
       * A task has a more technical nature.
       * A task can be referred as "issue".

    Few examples of tasks could be:

    *   a feature being developed by a software team
    *   a to-do item for a marketing team
    *   a contract that needs to be written by the legal team

![task](../images/Initial-images/Jira/task.jpg)

*   **_Sub-Tasks_**

    *   Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately.
    *   It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do.
    *   A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task.

*   **_Projects_**

    A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to:

    *   Coordinate the development of a product
    *   Track a project
    *   Manage a help desk

    Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. 
    
    Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. 

![projects](../images/Initial-images/Jira/projects.jpg)

*   **_Workflows_**

    Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this:

    ![workflow](../images/Initial-images/Jira/workflow.jpg)

    In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. 

*   **_Epics_**

    *   An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks.
    *   Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative.
    *   An Epic can run across multiple versions.

![epic](../images/Initial-images/Jira/epics.jpg)


*   **_Stories_**

    *   Also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
    *   At Krenovate, we do not use stories.


*   **_Versions_**

    *   Versions are points-in-time for a project.
    *   Versions can be termed as "Phases of launch" of a project.
    *   They help you schedule and organize your releases.
    *   You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version.
    *   Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue.

![version](../images/Initial-images/Jira/version.jpg)


*   **_Backlog_**

    *   It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you.
    *   The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints.
    *   You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints.

![backlog](../images/Initial-images/Jira/backlog.jpg)


*   **_Sprints_**

    *   It can be termed as a "Timeline of tasks".
    *   A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. 
    *   A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog.
    *   Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long.


*   **_Active Sprints_**

    *   An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on.
    *   You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow.

*   **_Components_**

    *   Components represent stakeholders of a project.
    *   Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects.
    *   Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project.

## **Task Allocation and Management**

Tasks in Jira are allocated by your Manager. Below are a few tasks which are to be handled ONLY by managers:

-   Create a Project
-   Assign issues to Users
-   Manage Users/Team members
-   Track time for users


As a user, the most important thing to understand is the tasks allocated to you and how to manage them.

In this section, we will discusss about tasks allocated to you in detail.

Once, your Jira account is activated, your manager will assign tasks to you.
