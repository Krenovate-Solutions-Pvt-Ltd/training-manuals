### **_Key terms to know_**

*   Issues

    A Jira 'issue' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. For example, an issue could be a feature being developed by a software team, a to-do item for a marketing team, or a contract that needs to be written by a legal team.

    Common terms used to refer to issues are:

    *   requests
    *   tickets
    *   tasks

*   Projects

    A project is, quite simply, a collection of issues that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to:

    *   Coordinate the development of a product
    *   Track a project
    *   Manage a help desk

Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like issues by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. 

*   Workflows

    Workflows represent the sequential path an issues takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this:

    In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status an issue can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another.
