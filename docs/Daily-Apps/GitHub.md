GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

GitHub is used as a version control tool. Version controlling your document allows you to:

1.  Track developments and changes in your documents.
2.  Record the changes you made to your document in a way that you will be able to understand later.
3.  Experiment with different versions of a document while maintaining the original version.
4.  ‘Merge’ two versions of a document and manage conflicts between versions.
5.  Revert changes, moving ‘backwards’ through your history to previous versions of your document.
