It brings more structure to your work, gives you increased visibility into what your team is up to, and helps your team members get more done, so you can deliver better service. It is used primarily: By teams who receive incoming issues/requests from other teams/customers. Is designed specifically for end-users to submit tickets to a help desk team. Why use Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira Service Desk integrates directly with Jira and brings you all the power and productivity of Jira to your service desk teams in the below ways: An intuitive, customer-centered interface - It lets you craft easy-to-use forms for your users. Create clean and simple customer portals with clear calls to action. Build templates for users to enter all the details you need. Display contextual information, re-map statuses, and hide fields your users don\u2019t need. A powerful service level agreement (SLA) engine - Jira Service Desk manages your service level agreement (SLA) commitments out of the box: Set up advanced SLA metrics with complex start, pause, and stop criteria. Ensure your IT teams keep priorities front of mind with clear countdown and color codes for every request Let Jira automatically apply relevant targets on each new request with its powerful rules engine. Customizable team queues - Manual triage and prioritization of requests is a thing of the past: Set up queues of requests automatically shared across all IT team members Improve the visibility and alignment of your IT teams with live updating queues Use the power of JQL to customize the ordering of the requests within a queue Real-time reports and analytics - \"That which gets measured, gets improved\" . With Jira Service Desk, you can assess performance and improve your IT team\u2019s efficiency: Get insights out of the box with key volume and time-based reports. Assess progress and identify bottlenecks in real time Apply SLA metrics retroactively to your current Jira data to observe trends The difference between Jira and Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira , is for internal teams to work together on issues/projects, whereas, Jira Service Desk . lets the end users submit tickets which can be tracked by the service desk team. Jira , can be very technical for people who don't use it everyday, whereas, Jira Service Desk is quick, and easy due to it's simple interface. Jira Service Desk Features \u00b6 Once you have navigated to your service desk, you\u2019ll find the sidebar, which has helpful features which you may want to use: Queues Queues are where your agents work on customer requests. As a project administrator, you\u2019ll set up and configure queues to triage requests to the right service desk agents. Your agents will then view and work on these requests from your queues. Reports You can use reports to visualize trends in your service desk. As a project administrator, you can also set up custom reports to discover new trends not displayed by the default reports. Channels Channels are where you can find the ways customers send you requests. Here, you can get details for your email, help center, and widget channels. Project settings Project settings are where you can configure your service desk. Here, you can set up request types, link your service desk to an email account, manage users, and more. Service Desk Project \u00b6 You can create projects in Jira Service Desk. Projects are service desks that provide help to customers. You can create multiple projects to give each service team in your organization their own service desk. For example, you might have a Finance, a HR, Facilities, IT or Legal service desk project. Customers can access every service desk project that you\u2019ve given them permission to from the help center\u2014an online place for them to request help. Before you create a service desk project, you choose a project template for it. After you sign up for Jira Service Desk, you\u2019re asked to choose a template for your first service desk project. Depending on your organization\u2019s needs, we start your project with reports, request types and other tools. You can always configure your project later. User types and Roles \u00b6 Primarily there are two licensed roles: administrators and agents. The administrator sets up and configures service desk projects. The agent works in these projects.

It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The basic use of this tool is to plan, track, and release software. At Krenovate, Jira is the most important used app due to it's project management and task tracking tools. Account Creation \u00b6 Your account on Jira will be created by the HR department. And you will get a link for logging into your account on your official email ID. Create your login credentials and remember the same for unnecessary hassle. Once you create your account, please contact your manager to assign you to relevant projects. Logging In \u00b6 To log in, please visit - krenovate.atlassian.net and click on the sign in button. Please use your credentials to log in. For free tutorial visit: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides Key terms to know \u00b6 Tasks A Jira 'task' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. A task represents work that needs to be done. A task has a more technical nature. A task can be referred as \"issue\". Few examples of tasks could be: a feature being developed by a software team a to-do item for a marketing team a contract that needs to be written by the legal team Sub-Tasks Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do. A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task. Projects A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to: Coordinate the development of a product Track a project Manage a help desk Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. Workflows Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this: In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. Epics An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. An Epic can run across multiple versions. Stories Also called \u201cuser stories,\u201d are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. At Krenovate, we do not use stories. Versions Versions are points-in-time for a project. Versions can be termed as \"Phases of launch\" of a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases. You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version. Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue. Backlog It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you. The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints. You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints. Sprints It can be termed as a \"Timeline of tasks\". A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. Active Sprints An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on. You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow. Components Components represent stakeholders of a project. Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects. Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project. Watch the tutorial to understand the key terms Task Allocation and Management \u00b6 Description of Task \u00b6 As a user, the most important thing to understand is the tasks allocated to you and how to manage them. In this section we will discusss ablout task allocation in detail. Once, your Jira account is activated: Your manager will assign tasks to you. You will receive an email intimation for task assigned. Click on \"View Issue\". You will be taken to the task description page in Jira. Task description will tell you about all the work to be done under that task. On the right side of the screen various options are available: Status of the task: When task is assigned it shows \"To Do\" Task should never be marked as \"In Progress\" Assignee: It is the user name who is assigned the task. Reporter: This shows your manager name Time Tracking: This shows the duration of time spent in performing the task. Time is tracked using the Hubstaff Recorder App Sprint: Shows the name of the active sprint of which the task is a part. Priority: Here the priority can be set as low, medium, high depending on the project requirement. Commenting & Discussing \u00b6 While you're working on an issue, you will probably need to share some information, clarify some requirements, or discuss some details about the issue with your team. This is easy to do with issue comments: You can comment, attach files, send links through the comment section of the task. To email other users about your comment, simply mention these users in the Comment text box (by typing @User's Name). An email will be sent to the users' email addresses that are registered with their JIRA accounts. All formatting options are available within. Click on Save Once you add a comment, a mail notification is received by the tagged person. History \u00b6 The history tab gives a detailed view of all the activity that takes place while performing the task. Work Log \u00b6 The work log tab shows the time spent of doing the task. Attachments & Files \u00b6 You can attach relevant files, images from the attachment tab below the task name. Creating a Sub-task \u00b6 Within the assigned task, your can add sub-tasks to organise your work. Click on Create Subtask Enter the description of the sub-task and click on create. Marking Task Complete \u00b6 After your work has been reviewed and approved, the last step is to close or resolve the issue. Select \"Done\" in the task status option.

These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct. The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent. General Employee Responsibilities \u00b6 All Employees are expected to: Understand the importance of each Krenovate policy and guideline in relation to his/her job and follow it religiously.

A family member is a Director, officer, employee or consultant in a company (clients/suppliers) that has business dealings with Krenovate or competes with Krenovate.

It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate. Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author.

Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, \u00a9 they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation. Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel. When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate.

All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee. In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others. All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team. Maintaining Confidentiality \u00b6 Krenovate Employees are required to keep all Krenovate confidential information, which is received or accessible during and subsequent to employment, in strictest confidence and protect them from unauthorised disclosure. Confidential information includes all information thta is not available in the public domain, such as IP; trade secrets; business; marketing and service plans; databases and records; login details; salary information; customer and supplier lists; major contracts and any unpublished financial data and reports. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them by Krenovate and/or its clients and/or suppliers. Krenovate's policy requires that all disclosures of confidential information are done only after the party, to whom the information is to be disclosed, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Krenovate. Employees should not disclose, publish, communicate, described directly or indirectly, in any form or manner any confidential information to any third party without a valid business purpose and proper authorisation from Executive Team and the Legal Department. Employees are also required not to disclose confidential information (even within Krenovate) to anyone who does not need to have such confidential information. Employees need to have safeguards against not only intentional and wilful disclosures but also against inadvertent disclosures. Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to be aware and alert of such circumstances or situations where there is a chance of an unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Examples of such circumstances can be: discussing client related information or other confidential information with a colleague in a crowded elevator or during lunch hour sitting in the cafeteria where Employees from other teams are also seated. Krenovate Employees are strictly prohibited from discussing Krenovate confidential information with their family members or friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass such information on to someone else. Not only are Employees required to maintain the confidentiality of the information but they should only use it for Krenovate business and not for any personal benefit or reasons. Employees are urged to be aware of social engineering techniques deployed for extracting confidential information. With regard to Information owned by/about other parties, Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to: Not exercise improper/illegal means for obtaining information about Krenovate competitors.

Only disclose confidential information about Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients to those Employees who need to know such information to transact business with such suppliers, vendors or clients.

Antitrust laws impose severe penalties, including criminal penalties, for certain types of violations. All Employees and Representatives who have periodic contact with competitors of Krenovate need to be ever mindful of these laws and strive to avoid placing themselves in situations that might create even the appearance of impropriety. Employees in managerial positions will be responsible for taking appropriate measures in their respective areas to achieve strict legal compliance, both by themselves and by their subordinates.

End-user Computing Policy is aimed at providing preventive/corrective measures to be taken for minimising risks arising from computing resources used by end-users. The policy statements in the End-user Computing Policy document are extracted from core Krenovate Information Security Policies. The objectives of this policy are as follows: To set forth, acceptable usage norms for the Krenovate End-user computing resources; To foster and maintain an environment where the management and end-users have confidence in the security of these resources; To ensure that all applicable hardware inventory and software licensing requirements are met; and Establish consistency in computer use procedures and regulations at Krenovate. Scope \u00b6 This poiicy is applicable to all users of computing resources at Krenovate. The term \"resources\" includes, but is not necessarily limited to: Personal Computers/Laptops (networked and stand-alone); Network Infrastructure (includes active networking equipment, data ports, connecting cables and switches); Project Servers; Internal Tools and Software; Application Servers; Database Servers; Intranet Servers; or Gateways used to access external networks, such as the Internet. User Responsibilities \u00b6 Users should understand and follow the Information Security Policies of Krenovate as they relate to safeguarding of information assets. Users will be accountable for their actions. Users need to respect the rights of other users, including their rights as set forth in other policies; these rights include but are not limited to privacy, freedom from harassment and freedom of expression. Users should respect the computing needs of others by not deliberately performing acts that are wasteful of computing resources or those thet unfairly monopolise resources to the exclusion of other users. Users are not permitted to use the name of Krenovate clients in their general communication (written or verbal) unless required for the business function. Users need to exercise due precautions to ensure that client details or sensitive business information are not discussed in a public place or any other location where outsiders/other process group Employees might have access to. Users are not permitted to send any client/official data to any personal/third-party email ID without the prior approval of their Group Head/CISO. Krenovate follows the policy of data classification under the following heads: confidential, restricted, internal and public. Users are required to have a fair understanding of the definition, implication and handling procedure for each from their group heads/HR/ISG. Data stored on local hard drives is susceptibie to toss of critical files. Chances of recovering data from hardware failures or loss of disk resources are less, thus users should save their project- related data on the network file servers. Important files such as client project deliverables should be stored on network file servers in the client deliverables folder with appropriate access control measures (accessible only to the respective project team and the project owner) on the completion of the projects or on appropriate milestones [as decided by the project manager(s)]. Users will work and save all their project-related data in the client project's Work in Progress (WIP) folder on the network file server till the completion of the project or as decided by the project manager(s). Users will be responsible for maintaining the security and integrity of research work/deliverables and other business documents developed/processed by them for performing their job. Users are accountable for ensuring that information being processed by them is made available only to the authorised employees within the organisation. Users should not save any personal document, such as pictures, songs, etc., on the network file server and local desktops. Any such personal document found on the server will be deleted, and the user will be liable for disciplinary action. The content of any infortnation made available to others via the Krenovate network is the sole responsibility of the project manager(s) handling the project/the employee who is sending the information. Information contained in computer files should be accessed or used for authorised business purposes only. Casual browsing of computer files stored on other user's machines for personal reasons is strictly prohibited. Personal software/software downloaded from the Internet should not be loaded on Krenovate computers. If there is a specific reason for which the same needs to be done, a prior approval of both the CISO and the respective business function head needs to be obtained. The request should state the duration of the use and project details for which such a requirement is necessary. (Also refer to the \"Internet Usage Policies\" mentioned below). Management may approve limited personal use of Krenovate's computing resources on request. Users shall not use Krenovate resources (including scanners, fax machines, printers and CD burning facility) for their personal work and are responsible for following the policies and procedures developed by Krenovate for the use of these facilities. No personal document will be scanned or sent by fax outside the Krenovate premises. Computers should neither be used for commercial purposes nor should personal use interfere with normal business operations. Users shall not damage, alter or disrupt computer systems. Users will not bring or use any personal entertainment/computing devices/storage media, such as voice recorders, cameras, headphones, floppies, CDs/DVDs, USB drives, flash disks, hard drives, laptops, iPods, etc inside the office premises. Users shall put the printed copies of official data (if it is not to be used in future) in the shredder box. In the course of normal day-to-day operations, users should be aware that ISG may audit, monitor and log desktop activities, with or without notice, if a situation warrants immediate or further investigation. In cases where the ISG is investigating possible misuse, files, programmes, hard copies or other computing material may be examined without notice. All the users should report any observed (or suspected) security weaknesses/incidents to the ISG. Such activities include, but are not limited to the following: Violation of Information Security Policies and Procedures; Breach of confidentiality/access control; Software malfunction; Virus activity; System failure; or Degradation of information processing services. All the users must be uniquely identified and authenticated before being allowed to access the Internet.
