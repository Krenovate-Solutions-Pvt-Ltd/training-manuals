It brings more structure to your work, gives you increased visibility into what your team is up to, and helps your team members get more done, so you can deliver better service. It is used primarily: By teams who receive incoming issues/requests from other teams/customers. Is designed specifically for end-users to submit tickets to a help desk team. Why use Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira Service Desk integrates directly with Jira and brings you all the power and productivity of Jira to your service desk teams in the below ways: An intuitive, customer-centered interface - It lets you craft easy-to-use forms for your users: Create clean and simple customer portals with clear calls to action. Build templates for users to enter all the details you need. Display contextual information, re-map statuses, and hide fields your users don\u2019t need. A powerful service level agreement (SLA) engine - Jira Service Desk manages your service level agreement (SLA) commitments out of the box: Set up advanced SLA metrics with complex start, pause, and stop criteria. Ensure your IT teams keep priorities front of mind with clear countdown and color codes for every request Let Jira automatically apply relevant targets on each new request with its powerful rules engine. Customizable team queues - Manual triage and prioritization of requests is a thing of the past: Set up queues of requests automatically shared across all IT team members Improve the visibility and alignment of your IT teams with live updating queues Use the power of JQL to customize the ordering of the requests within a queue Real-time reports and analytics - \"That which gets measured, gets improved\" . With Jira Service Desk, you can assess performance and improve your IT team\u2019s efficiency: Get insights out of the box with key volume and time-based reports. Assess progress and identify bottlenecks in real time Apply SLA metrics retroactively to your current Jira data to observe trends The difference between Jira and Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira , is for internal teams to work together on issues/projects, whereas, Jira Service Desk . lets the end users submit tickets which can be tracked by the service desk team. Jira , can be very technical for people who don't use it everyday, whereas, Jira Service Desk is quick, and easy due to it's simple interface. Jira Service Desk Features \u00b6 Once you have navigated to your service desk, you\u2019ll find the sidebar, which has helpful features which you may want to use: Queues Queues are where your agents work on customer requests. As a project administrator, you\u2019ll set up and configure queues to triage requests to the right service desk agents. Your agents will then view and work on these requests from your queues. Reports You can use reports to visualize trends in your service desk. As a project administrator, you can also set up custom reports to discover new trends not displayed by the default reports. Channels Channels are where you can find the ways customers send you requests. Here, you can get details for your email, help center, and widget channels. Project settings Project settings are where you can configure your service desk. Here, you can set up request types, link your service desk to an email account, manage users, and more. Service Desk Project \u00b6 You can create projects in Jira Service Desk. Projects are service desks that provide help to customers. You can create multiple projects to give each service team in your organization their own service desk. For example, you might have a Finance, a HR, Facilities, IT or Legal service desk project. Customers can access every service desk project that you\u2019ve given them permission to from the help center\u2014an online place for them to request help. Before you create a service desk project, you choose a project template for it. After you sign up for Jira Service Desk, you\u2019re asked to choose a template for your first service desk project. Depending on your organization\u2019s needs, we start your project with reports, request types and other tools. You can always configure your project later.
