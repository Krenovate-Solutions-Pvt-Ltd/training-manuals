It brings more structure to your work, gives you increased visibility into what your team is up to, and helps your team members get more done, so you can deliver better service. It is used primarily: By teams who receive incoming issues/requests from other teams/customers. Is designed specifically for end-users to submit tickets to a help desk team. Why use Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira Service Desk integrates directly with Jira and brings you all the power and productivity of Jira to your service desk teams in the below ways: An intuitive, customer-centered interface - It lets you craft easy-to-use forms for your users. Create clean and simple customer portals with clear calls to action. Build templates for users to enter all the details you need. Display contextual information, re-map statuses, and hide fields your users don\u2019t need. A powerful service level agreement (SLA) engine - Jira Service Desk manages your service level agreement (SLA) commitments out of the box: Set up advanced SLA metrics with complex start, pause, and stop criteria. Ensure your IT teams keep priorities front of mind with clear countdown and color codes for every request Let Jira automatically apply relevant targets on each new request with its powerful rules engine. Customizable team queues - Manual triage and prioritization of requests is a thing of the past: Set up queues of requests automatically shared across all IT team members Improve the visibility and alignment of your IT teams with live updating queues Use the power of JQL to customize the ordering of the requests within a queue Real-time reports and analytics - \"That which gets measured, gets improved\" . With Jira Service Desk, you can assess performance and improve your IT team\u2019s efficiency: Get insights out of the box with key volume and time-based reports. Assess progress and identify bottlenecks in real time Apply SLA metrics retroactively to your current Jira data to observe trends The difference between Jira and Jira Service Desk \u00b6 Jira , is for internal teams to work together on issues/projects, whereas, Jira Service Desk . lets the end users submit tickets which can be tracked by the service desk team. Jira , can be very technical for people who don't use it everyday, whereas, Jira Service Desk is quick, and easy due to it's simple interface. Jira Service Desk Features \u00b6 Once you have navigated to your service desk, you\u2019ll find the sidebar, which has helpful features which you may want to use: Queues Queues are where your agents work on customer requests. As a project administrator, you\u2019ll set up and configure queues to triage requests to the right service desk agents. Your agents will then view and work on these requests from your queues. Reports You can use reports to visualize trends in your service desk. As a project administrator, you can also set up custom reports to discover new trends not displayed by the default reports. Channels Channels are where you can find the ways customers send you requests. Here, you can get details for your email, help center, and widget channels. Project settings Project settings are where you can configure your service desk. Here, you can set up request types, link your service desk to an email account, manage users, and more. Service Desk Project \u00b6 You can create projects in Jira Service Desk. Projects are service desks that provide help to customers. You can create multiple projects to give each service team in your organization their own service desk. For example, you might have a Finance, a HR, Facilities, IT or Legal service desk project. Customers can access every service desk project that you\u2019ve given them permission to from the help center\u2014an online place for them to request help. Before you create a service desk project, you choose a project template for it. After you sign up for Jira Service Desk, you\u2019re asked to choose a template for your first service desk project. Depending on your organization\u2019s needs, we start your project with reports, request types and other tools. You can always configure your project later. User types and Roles \u00b6 Primarily there are two licensed roles: administrators and agents. The administrator sets up and configures service desk projects. The agent works in these projects.

It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The basic use of this tool is to plan, track, and release software. At Krenovate, Jira is the most important used app due to it's project management and task tracking tools. Account Creation \u00b6 Your account on Jira will be created by the HR department. And you will get a link for logging into your account on your official email ID. Create your login credentials and remember the same for unnecessary hassle. Once you create your account, please contact your manager to assign you to relevant projects. Logging In \u00b6 To log in, please visit - krenovate.atlassian.net and click on the sign in button. Please use your credentials to log in. For free tutorial visit: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides Key terms to know \u00b6 Tasks A Jira 'task' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. A task represents work that needs to be done. A task has a more technical nature. A task can be referred as \"issue\". Few examples of tasks could be: a feature being developed by a software team a to-do item for a marketing team a contract that needs to be written by the legal team Sub-Tasks Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do. A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task. Projects A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to: Coordinate the development of a product Track a project Manage a help desk Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. Workflows Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this: In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. Epics An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. An Epic can run across multiple versions. Stories Also called \u201cuser stories,\u201d are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. At Krenovate, we do not use stories. Versions Versions are points-in-time for a project. Versions can be termed as \"Phases of launch\" of a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases. You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version. Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue. Backlog It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you. The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints. You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints. Sprints It can be termed as a \"Timeline of tasks\". A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. Active Sprints An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on. You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow. Components Components represent stakeholders of a project. Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects. Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project. Watch the tutorial to understand the key terms Task Allocation and Management \u00b6 Description of Task \u00b6 As a user, the most important thing to understand is the tasks allocated to you and how to manage them. In this section we will discusss ablout task allocation in detail. Once, your Jira account is activated: Your manager will assign tasks to you. You will receive an email intimation for task assigned. Click on \"View Issue\". You will be taken to the task description page in Jira. Task description will tell you about all the work to be done under that task. On the right side of the screen various options are available: Status of the task: When task is assigned it shows \"To Do\" Task should never be marked as \"In Progress\" Assignee: It is the user name who is assigned the task. Reporter: This shows your manager name Time Tracking: This shows the duration of time spent in performing the task. Time is tracked using the Hubstaff Recorder App Sprint: Shows the name of the active sprint of which the task is a part. Priority: Here the priority can be set as low, medium, high depending on the project requirement. Commenting & Discussing \u00b6 While you're working on an issue, you will probably need to share some information, clarify some requirements, or discuss some details about the issue with your team. This is easy to do with issue comments: You can comment, attach files, send links through the comment section of the task. To email other users about your comment, simply mention these users in the Comment text box (by typing @User's Name). An email will be sent to the users' email addresses that are registered with their JIRA accounts. All formatting options are available within. Click on Save Once you add a comment, a mail notification is received by the tagged person. History \u00b6 The history tab gives a detailed view of all the activity that takes place while performing the task. Work Log \u00b6 The work log tab shows the time spent of doing the task. Attachments & Files \u00b6 You can attach relevant files, images from the attachment tab below the task name. Creating a Sub-task \u00b6 Within the assigned task, your can add sub-tasks to organise your work. Click on Create Subtask Enter the description of the sub-task and click on create. Marking Task Complete \u00b6 After your work has been reviewed and approved, the last step is to close or resolve the issue. Select \"Done\" in the task status option.

These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct. The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent.

Before acquiring or using any such software, Employees are required to contact the IT Department and/or Legal Department to ensure that all third party intellectual property rights related to such software use are fully complied with. ( Refer to the **Krenovate End User Computing Policy* for more information*) Proprietary Information : Properietary Information is any information owned by and related to Krenovate, such as information on Krenovate's databases, Krenovate's business clients/customers details, personnel details, medical and salary records, copyrighted materials, Krenovate's technical or scientific information relating to current and future products, services or research; business or marketing plans or projections; earnings, credit and other financial data; executive and organizational change, software and othe confidential information relating to the Company. All Krenovate properietary information is confidential in nature unless specifically classified otherwise. This information may also be subject to copyright, patent and other intellectual property and legal rights. Authority to Make Business Commitments \u00b6 The authority to make business and/or financial commitments on behalf of Krenovate has been clearly defined by way of clear delegation of authority, and all Employees and Representatives are expected to work in accordance with the same. Employees and Representatives should not make any oral or written commitments, arrangements or promises of business that create a new agreement or modify abn existing agreement with a third party without proper approval. Such commitments should be made by those having defined authority, and acting within the limits of the said authority. Any and all forms of misrepresentation, fraud, dishonesty and deception are to be avoided by Employees and Representatives. Conflict of Interest \u00b6 Employees must avoid any relationships which create a perceived or actual conflict between their obligation to Krenovate and personal self-interest. An Employee's financial, business or other non-work related activities must be lawful and free of conflicts with the Employees's responsibilities to Krenovate. Employees and Representatives must not, as part of engaging in any outside activities, misuse Krenovate resources, discredit its name and reputation or affect its business in any way. Employees and Representatives should not participate in any business or personal relationships, activities, or dealing that might adversely affect Krenovate. Although it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of every possible situation that may lead to a conflict of interest, given below are a few illustrations or possible conflicts of interest: You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company (clients/suppliers) that has dealing with Krenovate, and you are in a position to influence those dealings or if you have access to non-public information about that company. You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company that competes with Krenovate. A family member is a Director, officer, employee or consultant in a company (clients/suppliers) that has business dealings with Krenovate or competes with Krenovate. Your participation as a Director, officer, employee, consultant or promoter in an outside business prevents you from devoting full time to your job at Krenovate. Receipt of gifts from suppliers, clients or competitors. Potential conflict resulting from a family member or close friend working for or owning a supplier of Krenovate. Any outside activity or relationship which could reasonably be interpreted as being in conflict with the interests of Krenovate. Providing assistance to an organisation that markets products and services in competition with Krenovate's current or potential products or servcie offerings. Development and Protection of Intellectual Property \u00b6 Krenovate vigorously protects all of its confidential information and intellectual property (IP), whether in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks, and expects its Employees and Representatives to do the same. It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate. Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author. Trademarks (such as name, logo, combination of the name and logo) serve to identify products and services in the market and are distinctive in nature. Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, \u00a9 they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation. Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel. When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate. Subject to the relevant legislations, this applies no matter where or when- at work or after hours- such information (in tangible or intangible form) is created and is irrespective of the capacity in which the Employee created such work- be it managerial, technical, scientific or professional. All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee. In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others. All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team. Maintaining Confidentiality \u00b6 Krenovate Employees are required to keep all Krenovate confidential information, which is received or accessible during and subsequent to employment, in strictest confidence and protect them from unauthorised disclosure. Confidential information includes all information thta is not available in the public domain, such as IP; trade secrets; business; marketing and service plans; databases and records; login details; salary information; customer and supplier lists; major contracts and any unpublished financial data and reports. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them by Krenovate and/or its clients and/or suppliers. Krenovate's policy requires that all disclosures of confidential information are done only after the party, to whom the information is to be disclosed, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Krenovate. Employees should not disclose, publish, communicate, described directly or indirectly, in any form or manner any confidential information to any third party without a valid business purpose and proper authorisation from Executive Team and the Legal Department. Employees are also required not to disclose confidential information (even within Krenovate) to anyone who does not need to have such confidential information. Employees need to have safeguards against not only intentional and wilful disclosures but also against inadvertent disclosures. Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to be aware and alert of such circumstances or situations where there is a chance of an unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Examples of such circumstances can be: discussing client related information or other confidential information with a colleague in a crowded elevator or during lunch hour sitting in the cafeteria where Employees from other teams are also seated. Krenovate Employees are strictly prohibited from discussing Krenovate confidential information with their family members or friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass such information on to someone else. Not only are Employees required to maintain the confidentiality of the information but they should only use it for Krenovate business and not for any personal benefit or reasons. Employees are urged to be aware of social engineering techniques deployed for extracting confidential information. With regard to Information owned by/about other parties, Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to: Not exercise improper/illegal means for obtaining information about Krenovate competitors. Not attempt or solicit or obtain competitive intelligence through improper means or through means which could be disparaging to Krenovate reputation. Treat information of all third parties (including Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients) with utmost care and confidentiality and respect the privacy rights of such parties. Treat any proprietary information of another party that is received, with caution to prevent any accusations that Krenovate misappropriated or misused such information. Only disclose confidential information about Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients to those Employees who need to know such information to transact business with such suppliers, vendors or clients. Exercise extra caution while dealing with clients personnel about whom there may be reasonable ground of belief that, due to change in client's organisation internal dynamics, such personnel may become unauthorised to receive/access any confidential information. Regard all information received as Confidential, if it is not known that such information is confidential or not, and to exercise all due care with regard to maintaining confidentiality of such information. All queries in this regard should be referred to the Legal Department.

Employees and Representatives must not, as part of engaging in any outside activities, misuse Krenovate resources, discredit its name and reputation or affect its business in any way. Employees and Representatives should not participate in any business or personal relationships, activities, or dealing that might adversely affect Krenovate. Although it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of every possible situation that may lead to a conflict of interest, given below are a few illustrations or possible conflicts of interest: You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company (clients/suppliers) that has dealing with Krenovate, and you are in a position to influence those dealings or if you have access to non-public information about that company. You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company that competes with Krenovate. A family member is a Director, officer, employee or consultant in a company (clients/suppliers) that has business dealings with Krenovate or competes with Krenovate. Your participation as a Director, officer, employee, consultant or promoter in an outside business prevents you from devoting full time to your job at Krenovate. Receipt of gifts from suppliers, clients or competitors. Potential conflict resulting from a family member or close friend working for or owning a supplier of Krenovate. Any outside activity or relationship which could reasonably be interpreted as being in conflict with the interests of Krenovate. Providing assistance to an organisation that markets products and services in competition with Krenovate's current or potential products or servcie offerings.","title":"Conflict of Interest"},{"location":"Employee-Policies/Code-of-Business-Conduct-and-Ethics/#development-and-protection-of-intellectual-property","text":"Krenovate vigorously protects all of its confidential information and intellectual property (IP), whether in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks, and expects its Employees and Representatives to do the same. It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate. Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author. Trademarks (such as name, logo, combination of the name and logo) serve to identify products and services in the market and are distinctive in nature. Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, \u00a9 they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation. Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel. When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate. Subject to the relevant legislations, this applies no matter where or when- at work or after hours- such information (in tangible or intangible form) is created and is irrespective of the capacity in which the Employee created such work- be it managerial, technical, scientific or professional. All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee. In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others. All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team.","title":"Development and Protection of Intellectual Property"},{"location":"Employee-Policies/Code-of-Business-Conduct-and-Ethics/#maintaining-confidentiality","text":"Krenovate Employees are required to keep all Krenovate confidential information, which is received or accessible during and subsequent to employment, in strictest confidence and protect them from unauthorised disclosure. Confidential information includes all information thta is not available in the public domain, such as IP; trade secrets; business; marketing and service plans; databases and records; login details; salary information; customer and supplier lists; major contracts and any unpublished financial data and reports. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them by Krenovate and/or its clients and/or suppliers. Krenovate's policy requires that all disclosures of confidential information are done only after the party, to whom the information is to be disclosed, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Krenovate. Employees should not disclose, publish, communicate, described directly or indirectly, in any form or manner any confidential information to any third party without a valid business purpose and proper authorisation from Executive Team and the Legal Department. Employees are also required not to disclose confidential information (even within Krenovate) to anyone who does not need to have such confidential information. Employees need to have safeguards against not only intentional and wilful disclosures but also against inadvertent disclosures. Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to be aware and alert of such circumstances or situations where there is a chance of an unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Examples of such circumstances can be: discussing client related information or other confidential information with a colleague in a crowded elevator or during lunch hour sitting in the cafeteria where Employees from other teams are also seated. Krenovate Employees are strictly prohibited from discussing Krenovate confidential information with their family members or friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass such information on to someone else. Not only are Employees required to maintain the confidentiality of the information but they should only use it for Krenovate business and not for any personal benefit or reasons. Employees are urged to be aware of social engineering techniques deployed for extracting confidential information. With regard to Information owned by/about other parties, Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to: Not exercise improper/illegal means for obtaining information about Krenovate competitors. Not attempt or solicit or obtain competitive intelligence through improper means or through means which could be disparaging to Krenovate reputation. Treat information of all third parties (including Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients) with utmost care and confidentiality and respect the privacy rights of such parties. Treat any proprietary information of another party that is received, with caution to prevent any accusations that Krenovate misappropriated or misused such information. Only disclose confidential information about Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients to those Employees who need to know such information to transact business with such suppliers, vendors or clients. Exercise extra caution while dealing with clients personnel about whom there may be reasonable ground of belief that, due to change in client's organisation internal dynamics, such personnel may become unauthorised to receive/access any confidential information. Regard all information received as Confidential, if it is not known that such information is confidential or not, and to exercise all due care with regard to maintaining confidentiality of such information.
