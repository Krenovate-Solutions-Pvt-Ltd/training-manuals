It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The basic use of this tool is to plan, track, and release software. At Krenovate, Jira is the most important used app due to it's project management and task tracking tools. This manual is focussed on the Users/team members. It has been designed keeping in mind the steps to be taken by the Team members. Account Creation \u00b6 Your account on Jira will be created by the HR department.

Please use your credentials to log in. For free tutorial visit: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides Key terms to know \u00b6 Tasks A Jira 'task' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. A task represents work that needs to be done. A task has a more technical nature. A task can be referred as \"issue\". Few examples of tasks could be: a feature being developed by a software team a to-do item for a marketing team a contract that needs to be written by the legal team Sub-Tasks Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do. A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task. Projects A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to: Coordinate the development of a product Track a project Manage a help desk Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. Workflows Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this: In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. Epics An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. An Epic can run across multiple versions. Stories Also called \u201cuser stories,\u201d are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. At Krenovate, we do not use stories. Versions Versions are points-in-time for a project. Versions can be termed as \"Phases of launch\" of a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases. You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version. Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue. Backlog It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you. The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints. You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints. Sprints It can be termed as a \"Timeline of tasks\". A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. Active Sprints An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on. You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow. Components Components represent stakeholders of a project. Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects. Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project.

It\u2019s written in what people like to call \u201cplaintext\u201d, which is exactly the sort of text you\u2019re used to writing and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` ). It is now one of the world\u2019s most popular markup languages. Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

This is considered important in cases of books, theses, documents. Markdown is everywhere . Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it. Writing in Markdown \u00b6 Markdown uses basic syntax to format the content. Formatting text \u00b6 Formatting text in Markdown has a very gentle learning curve. It doesn\u2019t do anything fancy like change the font size, color, or type.

Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are a couple different reasons for this: Markdown can be used for everything - to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation. Markdown is portable . Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. Markdown is platform independent . You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system. Markdown is future proof . Even if the application you\u2019re using stops working at some point in the future, you\u2019ll still be able to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing application. This is considered important in cases of books, theses, documents. Markdown is everywhere .

Consistent with this belief, Krenovate considers it important to ensure an organisation climate free from discrimination and harassment with particular focus on Sexual Harassment. This Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy reflects Krenovate's commitment to ensure that Sexual Harassment of Employees which occurs at the workplace or in other settings in which Employees may find themselves in connection with their employnnent is unlawful and will not be tolerated. Krenovate therefore considers it the responsibility of every Employee and/or associated member of the Krenovate community to conduct himself/herself in a manner that contributes to an environment free of Sexual Harassment. This policy provides a brief of conduct that will not be tolerated and a procedure by which inappropriate conduct, if encountered by any Employee, will be strictly handled. Objective \u00b6 Krenovate is committed to implement best practices that will promote an equal and healthy workplace free from Sexual Harassment. The objectives of this policy therefore aim to: Create a work environment where all are treated with dignity and respect; Promote awareness about equality and Sexual Harassment; Ensure that Employees are aware of their rights and responsibilities with respect to equality and Sexual Harassment at workplace; Provide a prompt and effective redressal mechanism in responding to Sexual Harassment complaints; Maintain confidentiality of complainants and related matters; Not tolerate retaliation /intimidation against complainants and/or individuals cooperating with an investigation into a complaint of Sexual Harassment; and Create a non-hostile (conducive) work environment. Application \u00b6 This Anti-Sexual Harassnnent Policy is a global policy and applies to all Employees of Krenovate in all offices worldwide including full-time Employees, part-time employees directly or indirectly, whether for renumeration or not and any other person(s), acting pursuant to a contractual relationship with Krenovate. In addition, this policy shall extend to third-party harassment of Krenovate Employees, in both on- and off-site locations whether involved in employrnent or other activities on behalf of Krenovate. Definition \u00b6 \"Sexual harassment\" includes any one or more of the following unwelcome acts or behavior of sexual nature (whether directly or by implication), namely Physical contact and advances; Demand or request for sexual favours; Sexually coloured remarks; Showing pornography; or Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. Unwelcome sexually determined behaviour shall include, but not be limited to, the following instances: Where submission to such conduct is either an explicit ot implicit term or condition of employment, i.e., promotion, training, assigned duties or overtime assignments; Where submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as a basis for making employment decisions, i.e., hiring, advancement, and termination; or Where such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. What May Constitute Sexual Harassment \u00b6 Examples of Sexual Harassment include, but are not limited to: Unwanted sexual advances, whether involving physical contact or not; Unwanted and persistent explicit or implicit propositions to engage in sexual activity; Sexual jokes, derogatory sexual remarks, sexually explicit remarks or suggestions, written or oral references to sexual conduct, comments on an individual's body, suggestions that failure to oblige a sexual advance might result in unfair treatment; Unwelcome leering, whistling, brushing against the body, sexual gestures, sexually suggestive actions or faciai expressions; Unwanted and persistent social invitations; Remarks about sexual activities or speculation about sexual experiences; Persistent questions or insinuations about an individual's sexual life; Displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons, graphics, photographs, posters, calendars or other such materials; Sexual assault; Requests for sex; Offensive communication whether oral, written or electronic; Stalking; or Behaviour which creates an environment that is intimidating, hostile, or offensive for members of a particular sex and thus interferes with a person's ability to work. When determining whether conduct which, if unwelcome, amounts to Sexual Harassment, the totality of the circumstances including the subjective impact on the complainant, the context of the conduct, its severity, frequency and the professional relationship between the parties wili be taken into account. A single, isolated incident of such conduct (especially when the harasser has direct influence over the complainant), if sufficiently severe, may constitute Sexual Harassment under this Policy. Preventive Steps \u00b6 Consistent with the respective law laid down in various countries where Krenovate's offices are, the Company shall ensure all reasonable steps to prevent Sexual Harassment at the workplace. Such steps shall include: Circulating Krenovate's Anti-Sexuai Harassment Policy at its workplace(s). Ensuring Sexual Harassment as an issue is raised and discussed at Krenovate meetings from time to time. Conduct or cause to carry out in-house training on Sexual Harassment, in particular with those involved with responding to complaints and otherwise involved with the implementation of this policy. Establishing a complaints committee to respond to Sexual Harassment complaints as mentioned below. Implementing complaints committee's findings and recommendations. Management Obligations \u00b6 Pursuant to the preventive steps mentioned above, Krenovate's management shall take reasonable steps to: Provide all necessary assistance for the purpose of ensuring full, effective and prompt implementation of this policy. Conduct or cause to carry out orientation/awareness sessions on Sexual Harassrnent for all Krenovate employees and with respect to whom this policy applies. Conduct or cause to carry out skill and capacity building for those empowered to handle complaints pursuant to this policy. Set an example through their own behaviour and treat all with dignity and respect. Foster an environment free of discrimination. Treat all complaints as serious and maintain confidentiality to the extent reasonable, with respect to such complaints Ensure prompt redressal of any complaint. Ensure that any form or retaliation/intimidation/discrimination against an individual who has complained about Sexual Harassment or any individual who cooperates with an investigation of a Sexual Harassment complaint is not tolerated and is dealt with firmly. Employees' Obligations \u00b6 Pursuant to the preventive steps explained above, Krenovate Employees shall have a responsibility to: Become fully informed about and compliant with this Policy; Attend orientation/awareness session programs to be better informed about Sexual Harassment; Speak up where either they or someone they know is experiencing Sexual Harassment at work; Where possible, explain clearly to a person engaging in unwelcome conduct that the behaviour in question is not welcome, that it offends or creates discomfort and/or that it interferes with work; Offer information and support to any person who they suspect is being harassed and/or otherwise report any such instance of Sexual Harassment to the appropriate persons; Desist from and discourage spreading of rumours with regard to any instance of Sexual Harassment; and Maintain confidentiality regarding any aspect of an investigation which they may be party to. Complaints of Sexual Harassment \u00b6 If any Employee at Krenovate believes that she/he has been subjected to Sexual Harassment, she/he can avail of either an informal or formal complaint mechanism as described below. Informal Complaint Process \u00b6 For anyone seeking informal support/intervention to stop unwelcome behaviour, such person can approach his/her respective group managers or AVP, member of the Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee (ASHC)/ ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) or any other equivalent so designated by Krenovate (hereafter referred to as First Instance Person or FIP) as a point of first contact. Such FIPS shall be empowered to intervene to stop the unwelcome behaviour. Examples Of instances where a FIP may intervene include the following: X repeatedly tells off-colour jokes which are sexually loaded and create discomfort for Y. The FIP may warn X to desist from such behaviour. D, a colleague, persists in inviting E to go out for lunch. E has refused earlier, but D persists with his unsolicited invitations. The FIP may issue a warning to D to refrain from making such invitations. A makes sexually suggestive remarks about B's personal life. The FIP may demand an apology from A to B and warn A to desist from making such remarks. An informal process can often address unwelcome conduct/behaviour in the first instance before it escalates. At the same time it helps to diffuse a situation without diluting the problem. However, if the conduct persists or is determined by the FIP in consultation with the complainant to be of a serious nature, the complainant shall have a right to refer the matter to a formal complaint mechanism described below. Formal Complaint Process \u00b6 An Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee (ASHC)/ ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) will be constituted in the respective offices. Employees who believe that they have been subjected to Sexual Harassment will be encouraged to lodge a written complaint either personally or through a FIP who may have assisted the complainants or through those who have otherwise observed the Sexual Harassment as per the guidelines laid down in their respective offices. Requirements of a Complaint \u00b6 A complaint of Sexual Harassment should (to the extent practicable) be made in writing within a period of 3 months from the date of the incident and in case of a series of incidents, within a period of 3 months from the date of the last incident. If however the Committee is satisfied that the circumstances which prevented the complainant from filling a complaint within this period, it may for reasons recorded in writing, accept the complaint. However, given the importance of documenting a complaint of workplace sexual harassment, steps should be taken to do so at the earliest. The written account should include the date, time and place of the unwelcome conduct, a description of the events resulting in the misconduct, the complainant's response, and the names of witnesses, if any, present at the time of the inappropriate conduct or to whom the complainant may have spoken subsequent to the incident. While Krenovate appreciates the difficulty involved in detailing some kinds of Sexual Harassment, a complainant is encouraged to document as much detail as possible to allow for an effective response to the inappropriate conduct. Procedure on receipt of a Complain \u00b6 On receipt of a complaint, an ASHC member, chairperson, or FIP or any other person to whom the complaint has been lodged will be available to provide information on Krenovate's complaint process as per the applicable Anti-Sexual Harassment Guidelines. Thereafter, the appropriate process which is established at the respective Krenovate country office will be followed. Retaliation and/or creation of hostile work environment prohibited \u00b6 This Policy encourages employees to freely, responsibly, and in an orderly manner express any problem or complaint involving Sexual Harassment. All formal complaints of Sexual Harassment will be investigated. All steps shall be taken to ensure that neither the complainants nor those cooperating with an investigation, including witnesses are victimized or discriminated against in any way while dealing with a complaint of Sexual Harassment. Confidentiality \u00b6 All complaints of Sexual Harassment will be kept and treated as confidential to the extent practicable under the circumstances. Only those individuals who may have received the complaint or are necessarily involved in an investigatory process and in the decision regarding resolution of the complaint will ordinarily be provided access to the information regarding any allegation of Sexual Harassment. All information regarding Sexual Harassment complaints will be maintained in a confidential file to be kept with the head of the ASHC. Remedies \u00b6 An investigation may result in one (or a combination) of the following possible outcomes and consequential actions: That Krenovate's ASH Policy was not violated and that the complaint has not succeeded; or That Krenovate's ASH Policy has been violated, resulting in the imposition of disciplinary action as determined; or Given that Krenovate believes that Sexual Harassment is a serious violation of equality and individual dignity, appropriate action will follow a determination that inappropriate conduct has taken place. Disciplinary action may include oral reprimand, written reprimands, recommendation for suspension without pay, and recommendation for termination. Such action shall be calculated to be commensurate with the violation and as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. Savings \u00b6 The proceedings under this Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy shall not be stalled or postponed merely because the complainant is proceeding against the accused under any other provision of law. The provisions of this Anti-Sexual Harassment Policy shall not restrict the powers of the management or the complainant to proceed against the alleged offender for any other misconduct or other legal remedies.

Such FIPS shall be empowered to intervene to stop the unwelcome behaviour. Examples Of instances where a FIP may intervene include the following: X repeatedly tells off-colour jokes which are sexually loaded and create discomfort for Y. The FIP may warn X to desist from such behaviour. D, a colleague, persists in inviting E to go out for lunch. E has refused earlier, but D persists with his unsolicited invitations. The FIP may issue a warning to D to refrain from making such invitations. A makes sexually suggestive remarks about B's personal life. The FIP may demand an apology from A to B and warn A to desist from making such remarks. An informal process can often address unwelcome conduct/behaviour in the first instance before it escalates. At the same time it helps to diffuse a situation without diluting the problem. However, if the conduct persists or is determined by the FIP in consultation with the complainant to be of a serious nature, the complainant shall have a right to refer the matter to a formal complaint mechanism described below.","title":"Informal Complaint Process"},{"location":"Employee-Policies/Anti-Sexual-Harassment-Policy/#formal-complaint-process","text":"An Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee (ASHC)/ ICC (Internal Complaints Committee) will be constituted in the respective offices.

These are: Quality, Confidentiality, Integrity, Meritocracy and Obligation to Dissent. The COBE sets forth the legal and ethical standards and provides an overview of Krenovate guiding principles and these values. The Code is not intended to be all inclusive and does not cover every conceivable situation an Employee or a Representative may encounter. For that, we place a high degree of reliance on the judgement and discretion of the individual Employee or Representative and it is for him/her to decide what is right, including a decision to obtain guidance from others on the approriate course of conduct. The COBE is a dynamic document taht will constantly evolve over time as we continue to apply the best practices and principles to the complex and diversified issues/ situations of business conduct and ethics. However, as we change, refine and adapt our best practices, the organisation's commitment to integrity and honesty will always remain consistent. General Employee Responsibilities \u00b6 All Employees are expected to: Understand the importance of each Krenovate policy and guideline in relation to his/her job and follow it religiously. Know that violation of any Krenovate policy and guideline will result in disciplinary action (including immediate termination of employment). Use good judgement abd demonstrate a high degree of personal integrity and honesty at all times, even in situations that are not specifically addressed by this COBE or by a Krenovate policy. What Managers Need to Know \u00b6 In most cases, a Krenovate manager will be the first person to be contacted by an Employee whi believes that a Krenovate policy has been, or may be, violated.

Some examples of workplace harassment are continued or repeated verbal abuse; comments and jokes about ethnic backgrounds, race, religion, physical characteristics, racial or ethnic stereotypes; and graphic or degrading comments about an Employee's appearance. Sexual Harassment is a specific form of Workplace Harassment and Krenovate strictly prohibits any such kind of harassment.

Employees and Representatives should not make any oral or written commitments, arrangements or promises of business that create a new agreement or modify abn existing agreement with a third party without proper approval. Such commitments should be made by those having defined authority, and acting within the limits of the said authority. Any and all forms of misrepresentation, fraud, dishonesty and deception are to be avoided by Employees and Representatives. Conflict of Interest \u00b6 Employees must avoid any relationships which create a perceived or actual conflict between their obligation to Krenovate and personal self-interest. An Employee's financial, business or other non-work related activities must be lawful and free of conflicts with the Employees's responsibilities to Krenovate. Employees and Representatives must not, as part of engaging in any outside activities, misuse Krenovate resources, discredit its name and reputation or affect its business in any way. Employees and Representatives should not participate in any business or personal relationships, activities, or dealing that might adversely affect Krenovate. Although it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of every possible situation that may lead to a conflict of interest, given below are a few illustrations or possible conflicts of interest: You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company (clients/suppliers) that has dealing with Krenovate, and you are in a position to influence those dealings or if you have access to non-public information about that company. You (or your family member) have a significant financial interest in a company that competes with Krenovate. A family member is a Director, officer, employee or consultant in a company (clients/suppliers) that has business dealings with Krenovate or competes with Krenovate. Your participation as a Director, officer, employee, consultant or promoter in an outside business prevents you from devoting full time to your job at Krenovate. Receipt of gifts from suppliers, clients or competitors. Potential conflict resulting from a family member or close friend working for or owning a supplier of Krenovate. Any outside activity or relationship which could reasonably be interpreted as being in conflict with the interests of Krenovate.

Development and Protection of Intellectual Property \u00b6 Krenovate vigorously protects all of its confidential information and intellectual property (IP), whether in the form of patents, trade secrets, copyrights or trademarks, and expects its Employees and Representatives to do the same. It is critical that Krenovate maintains its reputation as a leader of creation and implementation of best practices to protect all IP that is developed by or disclosed to Krenovate. Krenovate accepts, as a professional responsibility, to respect and not knowingly violate third party intellectual property rights and copyrighted materials and to abide by all relevant copyright legislations. Employees are expected to abide by this and to accept it as their own personal responsibility. Most of Krenovate's work that is created is subject to copyright protecction and all such works should be accordingly identified to ensure that recipients of such work have knowledge of the same. Such work can include white papers and presentations, any source code that is developed and shared outside Krenovate, reports and articles submitted by Employees, training materials and manuals and other documentation, software programs and databases, etc. Copyright protection applies not only to printed materials but also to visual and electronic media. Copyright lawas protect all works of authorship even if they fo not carry the copyright symbol (C). Krenovate's policy prohibits the unauthorised reproduction of documents, portions of documents, images, reports and data and analysis created by any third party without giving due credit to the author or obtaining permission from the author. Trademarks (such as name, logo, combination of the name and logo) serve to identify products and services in the market and are distinctive in nature. Krenovate expects its Employees to properly acknowledge and use Krenovate's trademarks and trademarks of other companies at all times. Employees should ensure that (a) the trademark is spelt correctly and written the way the owner of the trademark writes it, (b) they do not use or copy or allow others to use or copy Krenovate trademark or a thrid party trademark without permission, \u00a9 they do not make commercial use of the name, likeness or distinctive personality traits of a trademark without first having obtained permission to do so, (d) they do not use Krenovate name or trademark, owned or associated with Krenovate, on any letterhead stationery and/or for any personal purpose without proper authorisation. Krenovate's trade secrets are essential and need to be protected by secrecy since we use considerable efforts to keep and maintain their confidentiality. Some examples of our trade secrets are: details of our clients, our pricing, number of our Employees, our proprietary methods of conducting research or providing other services to our clients and other similar types of information that are not known outside Krenovate or are only known to our clients with a need to know. Employees have the resposnsibility to keep all Krenovate information confidential and to disclose such information only to other Krenovate Employees with a need to know. Information identified as trade secret should also be subject to additional restrictions including limited access to the information (even among Krenovate Employees) and storage of information in segregated areas (or drives, if in an electronic medium) that can be accessed only by authorised personnel. When an Employee joins Krenovate, he/she is required to sign, at the time of employment, a non-disclosure agreement that restricts disclosure of proprietary, trade secret, and certain other information about Krenovate. During the employment of Krenovate, any ideas, inventions, discoveries, processes, formulas, business methods, concepts, designs, whitepapers, research notes, compilations, articles, publications, software, hardware, improvements, computer programs and documents that are developed, formulated, conceived or planned, using Krenovate time, material or resources and that relate to it's actual or anticipated business, research or development or that are suggested by, or result from work or tasks that an Employee acrries out for Krenovate, are the property of Krenovate and all intellectual property rights vest in Krenovate. Subject to the relevant legislations, this applies no matter where or when- at work or after hours- such information (in tangible or intangible form) is created and is irrespective of the capacity in which the Employee created such work- be it managerial, technical, scientific or professional. All proprietary assets and confidential information of Krenovate must be returned on cessation of employment. The duty to keep all Krenovate confidential and proprietary information in confidence extends beyond the cessation of employment of an Employee. In certain cases, Krenovate may procure the services of third parties (such as contract engineers, designers, software developers, web designers, outside development houses etc.). The hiring request in this regards should be referred to the Talent Acquisition team of the HR Department. The HR Compliance Team must review all such contractual arrangements, in consultation with the appropriate operations department, to ensure proper treatment of IP rights. While such individuals are hired because of their experience in various technical areas, Krenovate does not employ people as means of gaining access to trade secrets and sensitive information of others. All queries in this regard should be referred to the HR Compliance Team. Maintaining Confidentiality \u00b6 Krenovate Employees are required to keep all Krenovate confidential information, which is received or accessible during and subsequent to employment, in strictest confidence and protect them from unauthorised disclosure. Confidential information includes all information thta is not available in the public domain, such as IP; trade secrets; business; marketing and service plans; databases and records; login details; salary information; customer and supplier lists; major contracts and any unpublished financial data and reports. Employees must maintain the confidentiality of all information entrusted to them by Krenovate and/or its clients and/or suppliers. Krenovate's policy requires that all disclosures of confidential information are done only after the party, to whom the information is to be disclosed, has signed a non-disclosure agreement with Krenovate. Employees should not disclose, publish, communicate, described directly or indirectly, in any form or manner any confidential information to any third party without a valid business purpose and proper authorisation from Executive Team and the Legal Department. Employees are also required not to disclose confidential information (even within Krenovate) to anyone who does not need to have such confidential information. Employees need to have safeguards against not only intentional and wilful disclosures but also against inadvertent disclosures. Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to be aware and alert of such circumstances or situations where there is a chance of an unintentional disclosure of confidential information. Examples of such circumstances can be: discussing client related information or other confidential information with a colleague in a crowded elevator or during lunch hour sitting in the cafeteria where Employees from other teams are also seated. Krenovate Employees are strictly prohibited from discussing Krenovate confidential information with their family members or friends, who might innocently or unintentionally pass such information on to someone else. Not only are Employees required to maintain the confidentiality of the information but they should only use it for Krenovate business and not for any personal benefit or reasons. Employees are urged to be aware of social engineering techniques deployed for extracting confidential information. With regard to Information owned by/about other parties, Krenovate strongly urges its Employees to: Not exercise improper/illegal means for obtaining information about Krenovate competitors. Not attempt or solicit or obtain competitive intelligence through improper means or through means which could be disparaging to Krenovate reputation. Treat information of all third parties (including Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients) with utmost care and confidentiality and respect the privacy rights of such parties. Treat any proprietary information of another party that is received, with caution to prevent any accusations that Krenovate misappropriated or misused such information. Only disclose confidential information about Krenovate's suppliers, vendors, clients to those Employees who need to know such information to transact business with such suppliers, vendors or clients. Exercise extra caution while dealing with clients personnel about whom there may be reasonable ground of belief that, due to change in client's organisation internal dynamics, such personnel may become unauthorised to receive/access any confidential information. Regard all information received as Confidential, if it is not known that such information is confidential or not, and to exercise all due care with regard to maintaining confidentiality of such information. All queries in this regard should be referred to the Legal Department. Compliance with Laws \u00b6 Krenovate ensures that it complies with ail the relevant legislations and that we conduct our business within the framework of applicable laws and regulations.

Compliance with Competition Laws \u00b6 Krenovate's belief is that fair competition is fundamental to free enterprise and it is committed to ensure compliance with the competition laws of various countries as may be applicable to Krenovate business operations. These laws, known under various names such as antitrust, monopoly, fair trade etc, are designed to protect the market competitive process and to ensure that it is fair and healthy. These laws prohibit illegal agreements; collusion among competitors; formal or informal agreements with competitors that harm competition or customers; bid rigging, price fixing and allocations of clients, territories or contracts; the acquisition or nnaintenance of a monopoly or attempted monopoly through anti-competitive conduct etc. To ensure compliance with the various competition laws and in line with Krenovate policy, Krenovate strongly advocates that the following are strictly adhered to: Avoiding reciprocal dealing \u2014 avoidance of any kind of understanding with a client or supplier, which conditions sales or purchases of Krenovate products on reciprocal sales or purchases of the client's/supplier's products.

Antitrust laws impose severe penalties, including criminal penalties, for certain types of violations. All Employees and Representatives who have periodic contact with competitors of Krenovate need to be ever mindful of these laws and strive to avoid placing themselves in situations that might create even the appearance of impropriety. Employees in managerial positions will be responsible for taking appropriate measures in their respective areas to achieve strict legal compliance, both by themselves and by their subordinates.

Users will be accountable for their actions. Users need to respect the rights of other users, including their rights as set forth in other policies; these rights include but are not limited to privacy, freedom from harassment and freedom of expression. Users should respect the computing needs of others by not deliberately performing acts that are wasteful of computing resources or those thet unfairly monopolise resources to the exclusion of other users. Users are not permitted to use the name of Krenovate clients in their general communication (written or verbal) unless required for the business function. Users need to exercise due precautions to ensure that client details or sensitive business information are not discussed in a public place or any other location where outsiders/other process group Employees might have access to.

Users are required to have a fair understanding of the definition, implication and handling procedure for each from their group heads/HR/ISG. Data stored on local hard drives is susceptibie to toss of critical files. Chances of recovering data from hardware failures or loss of disk resources are less, thus users should save their project- related data on the network file servers. Important files such as client project deliverables should be stored on network file servers in the client deliverables folder with appropriate access control measures (accessible only to the respective project team and the project owner) on the completion of the projects or on appropriate milestones [as decided by the project manager(s)]. Users will work and save all their project-related data in the client project's Work in Progress (WIP) folder on the network file server till the completion of the project or as decided by the project manager(s).

Users are accountable for ensuring that information being processed by them is made available only to the authorised employees within the organisation. Users should not save any personal document, such as pictures, songs, etc., on the network file server and local desktops. Any such personal document found on the server will be deleted, and the user will be liable for disciplinary action. The content of any infortnation made available to others via the Krenovate network is the sole responsibility of the project manager(s) handling the project/the employee who is sending the information. Information contained in computer files should be accessed or used for authorised business purposes only. Casual browsing of computer files stored on other user's machines for personal reasons is strictly prohibited. Personal software/software downloaded from the Internet should not be loaded on Krenovate computers. If there is a specific reason for which the same needs to be done, a prior approval of both the CISO and the respective business function head needs to be obtained. The request should state the duration of the use and project details for which such a requirement is necessary. (Also refer to the \"Internet Usage Policies\" mentioned below). Management may approve limited personal use of Krenovate's computing resources on request. Users shall not use Krenovate resources (including scanners, fax machines, printers and CD burning facility) for their personal work and are responsible for following the policies and procedures developed by Krenovate for the use of these facilities.

Users shall put the printed copies of official data (if it is not to be used in future) in the shredder box. In the course of normal day-to-day operations, users should be aware that ISG may audit, monitor and log desktop activities, with or without notice, if a situation warrants immediate or further investigation. In cases where the ISG is investigating possible misuse, files, programmes, hard copies or other computing material may be examined without notice. All the users should report any observed (or suspected) security weaknesses/incidents to the ISG. Such activities include, but are not limited to the following: Violation of Information Security Policies and Procedures; Breach of confidentiality/access control; Software malfunction; Virus activity; System failure; or Degradation of information processing services. All the users must be uniquely identified and authenticated before being allowed to access the Internet. All activities performed under a user'S identity will be identifiable and users wilt be accountable for any activities performed using their identity.

This activity involves both secondary and primary research (individuals) to gain insights necessary to conduct work. The purpose of this document is to clearly state the guidelines followed at Krenovate while conducting this work. These standards are intended to protect the integrity, reputation, business and legal interests of our clients, the interviewees, as well as Krenovate. Strict adherence to these guidelines, all the time, is considered to be a condition of employment in our Company. Every person in our Company individually signs this document confirming their intent to abide by these guidelines. These guidelines are applicable to all the Employees of Krenovate and any other legal entity that is part of the Krenovate group of companies. General Rules \u00b6 In general, use common sense. If it \"feels\" unethical, it probably is. Do not deliberately mislead by making a false statement. Honesty is the best policy at all times. If at any time you are unsure whether a particular research situation might become potentially unethical or illegal, immediately raise the flag and discuss it with your reporting manager, client executive, senior management or the Krenovate Counsel. These rules overrule any instructions potentially given to you by anyone, be it knowingly or unknowingly, be it by the client or internally, leading to any potentially unethical or illegal situations. You have the \"obligation to dissent\" if you do not agree with the answers given to you by your superiors. If in doubt, discuss it directly with your reporting manager, senior managernent or the Krenovate Counsel. Client Confidentiality \u00b6 Always ensure that confidential information given to Krenovate by the client remains confidential including the client's name. The only exception is information that has been explicitly made public by the client in writing to Krenovate. Unless told otherwise, always keep the name of the client confidential. No confidential information received by the Krenovate team from the client shall be shared with any other team at Krenovate, either directly or indirectly. All appropriate precautions will be taken to this extent. Primary Research \u00b6 At the beginning of every primary research interview or survey, introduce yourself clearly stating your name and where you are calling from \u2014 either from Krenovate or one of its affiliates \u2014 and, if, and only if we have been told to disclose the client's name, working on a project on behalf of XYZ client. At no time attempt to hide or mislead regarding the fact that you are calling from the location of your office. If asked whether you are calling from a competitive intelligence firm, confirm that this is one of the services we provide. You can add that we conduct various types of market researches including segment and market analysis, product commercialisation studies, benchmarking, customer surveys, as well as intellectual property research services. If asked the name of the end-client by an interviewee or whether we are working for a direct competitor of theirs, state that it is our Connpany policy to keep all client names confidential. When conducting any research, be honest regarding the work you are doing. If we have developed a \"story line\" that explains our purpose for conducting the work, ensure that this story is honest and delivered according to the plan. When conducting a company profiling project covering our client's competitors in any way, if you are asked whether the information you are collecting will be used for the purpose of competitive intelligence \u2014 you should state that the information being collected will be used for a variety of purposes, including market and competitive intelligence, and should be given only if it is non-confidential from the interviewee's perspective. Never pressurise someone to provide information that they state is confidential. If you believe that information has come into our hands in violation of a confidentiality agreement or illegally, immediately notify your reporting manager or the senior management about this. Using confidential information is unethical and usually illegal, regardless of the manner in which it was obtained. If an interviewee or any relevant employee of a company being interviewed asks you to stop calling further employees of that company, immediately inform your reporting rnanager or the senior rnanagement and the appropriate client executive, and stop calling. Copyrights and Intellectual Policy \u00b6 When using secondary sources, be certain that you are not violating any copyright or trademark laws in using the data from these sources. If you have any question in this regard, immediately bring this to the attention of the reporting manager or the senior management. Since we are not an approved reseller of database information, we cannot simply forward \"cut and paste\" information from our paid sources to clients without any value addition. If asked by a client, discuss an appropriate response with your reporting manager or the senior management. All intellectual property developed on behalf of e client during the course of paid work, or received by the client, is and remains the client's property unless excluded by some explicit agreement. Any portion of data insubstantial in content extracted from databases and to be used in the deliverables needs to be sourced to the database or website.
