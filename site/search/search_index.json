It can contain folders, files, images, spreadsheets- anything a project needs. Branch Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. By default your repository has one branch named \"master\" which is considered to be the definitive branch. Every team member can clone the master branch to their own working branch. Commit On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you\u2019ve done and why. Pull Request Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you\u2019re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. Merge Pull Request In this final step, it\u2019s time to bring your changes together \u2013 merging your edited branches into the master branch. Github Flow \u00b6 Following is the GitHub flow: Create a branch from the repository. Create, edit, rename, move, or delete files. Send a pull request from your branch with your proposed changes to kick off a discussion. Make changes on your branch as needed. Your pull request will update automatically. Merge the pull request once the branch is ready to be merged. Tidy up your branches using the delete button in the pull request or on the branches page.","title":"GitHub"},{"location":"Daily-Apps/GitHub/#github","text":"","title":"Github"},{"location":"Daily-Apps/GitHub/#introduction","text":"GitHub brings teams together to work through problems, move ideas forward, and learn from each other along the way.

User Guide","title":"Service Desk Project"},{"location":"Daily-Apps/Jira/","text":"Jira \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 JIRA is a tool developed by Australian Company Atlassian. It is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. The basic use of this tool is to plan, track, and release software. At Krenovate, Jira is the most important used app due to it's project management and task tracking tools. Account Creation \u00b6 Your account on Jira will be created by the HR department. And you will get a link for logging into your account on your official email ID. Create your login credentials and remember the same for unnecessary hassle. Once you create your account, please contact your manager to assign you to relevant projects. Logging In \u00b6 To log in, please visit - krenovate.atlassian.net and click on the sign in button. Please use your credentials to log in. For free tutorial visit: https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides Key terms to know \u00b6 Tasks A Jira 'task' refers to a single work item of any type or size that is tracked from creation to completion. A task represents work that needs to be done. A task has a more technical nature. A task can be referred as \"issue\". Few examples of tasks could be: a feature being developed by a software team a to-do item for a marketing team a contract that needs to be written by the legal team Sub-Tasks Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do. A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task. Projects A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to: Coordinate the development of a product Track a project Manage a help desk Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. Workflows Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this: In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. Epics An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. An Epic can run across multiple versions. Stories Also called \u201cuser stories,\u201d are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. At Krenovate, we do not use stories. Versions Versions are points-in-time for a project. Versions can be termed as \"Phases of launch\" of a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases. You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version. Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue. Backlog It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you. The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints. You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints. Sprints It can be termed as a \"Timeline of tasks\". A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. Active Sprints An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on. You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow. Components Components represent stakeholders of a project. Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects. Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project. Watch the tutorial to understand the key terms Task Allocation and Management \u00b6 Description of Task \u00b6 As a user, the most important thing to understand is the tasks allocated to you and how to manage them. In this section we will discusss ablout task allocation in detail. Once, your Jira account is activated: Your manager will assign tasks to you. You will receive an email intimation for task assigned. Click on \"View Issue\". You will be taken to the task description page in Jira. Task description will tell you about all the work to be done under that task. On the right side of the screen various options are available: Status of the task: When task is assigned it shows \"To Do\" Task should never be marked as \"In Progress\" Assignee: It is the user name who is assigned the task. Reporter: This shows your manager name Time Tracking: This shows the duration of time spent in performing the task. Time is tracked using the Hubstaff Recorder App Sprint: Shows the name of the active sprint of which the task is a part. Priority: Here the priority can be set as low, medium, high depending on the project requirement. Commenting & Discussing \u00b6 While you're working on an issue, you will probably need to share some information, clarify some requirements, or discuss some details about the issue with your team. This is easy to do with issue comments: You can comment, attach files, send links through the comment section of the task. To email other users about your comment, simply mention these users in the Comment text box (by typing @User's Name). An email will be sent to the users' email addresses that are registered with their JIRA accounts. All formatting options are available within. Click on Save Once you add a comment, a mail notification is received by the tagged person. History \u00b6 The history tab gives a detailed view of all the activity that takes place while performing the task. Work Log \u00b6 The work log tab shows the time spent of doing the task.

A task represents work that needs to be done. A task has a more technical nature. A task can be referred as \"issue\". Few examples of tasks could be: a feature being developed by a software team a to-do item for a marketing team a contract that needs to be written by the legal team Sub-Tasks Subtask issues are useful for splitting up a parent issue into a number of smaller tasks that can be assigned and tracked separately. It addresses issues more comprehensively and segregates the task into smaller chunks of task to do. A sub-task has to be totally related to the parent task. Projects A project is, quite simply, a collection of Tasks, that are held in common by purpose or context. Teams can use a Jira project to: Coordinate the development of a product Track a project Manage a help desk Jira Software projects are flexible working spaces that allow you to group like tasks by team, business unit, product, or stream of work. Projects don't need to be tied to the same delivery date. Workflows Workflows represent the sequential path a task takes from creation to completion. A basic workflow might look something like this: In this case, Open, Done, and the labels in between represent the status a task can take, while the arrows represent potential transitions from one status to another. Epics An Epic is a large body of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks. Epics group together bugs, stories, and tasks to show the progress of a larger initiative. An Epic can run across multiple versions. Stories Also called \u201cuser stories,\u201d are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user. At Krenovate, we do not use stories. Versions Versions are points-in-time for a project. Versions can be termed as \"Phases of launch\" of a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases. You can assign tasks in your project to a specific version, and organise your sprints around completing work in that version. Versions that include end dates can indicate when a release is overdue. Backlog It is simply a list of tasks that represents outstanding work in a project assigned to you. The Backlog gives you place to organize your sprints. You can create new issues or sub-tasks, organize your backlog, create versions, organize via epics, and start sprints. Sprints It can be termed as a \"Timeline of tasks\". A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a team works to complete a set amount of work. A sprint is a fixed time period where teams complete work from their product backlog. Sprints are usually one, two, or four weeks long. Active Sprints An Active Sprint of a Scrum board displays the issues that your team is currently working on. You can create and update tasks/issues, drage and drop issues to transition them through a workflow. Components Components represent stakeholders of a project. Component Stakeholders are different group of people who are goig work on and use projects. Component is a generic term which can be used effectively to represent an module of an project.
